        Liby (Lisp In RubY)

        Oct. 5, 2009 Travis Whitton <tinymountain at gmail dot com>

Liby is a simple Lisp interpreter written in Ruby. It's heavily derived from
slisp which was written by Sandro Sigala. Liby implements a good number of
constructs seen in typical Lisp systems and may be useful for learning the
basis of the Lisp language.

[Requirements]
Everything required to run Liby should be included in your standard Ruby
install.

[How to install]
1. su to root
2. ruby setup.rb

to install in an alternate location
3. ruby setup.rb all --prefix=/some/other/location

[Usage]
See lib/builtin.rb for intrinsic functions. A library containing additional
functionality has been included in test/lisp/lisp.lsp. Liby uses dynamic
scoping in the same fashion as McCarthy's original Lisp did. Don't expect
to see macros anytime soon. See liby --help for command-line usage.

[Testing]
A test suite has been included in test/lisp/testsuite.lsp. All the assertions
pass successfully. This isn't to say Liby is 100% bug free. I'm saving the
special bugs for you to find.
